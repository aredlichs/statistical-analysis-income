Mode = There is no determined fashion for the project

Variance = This dataset contains a severe outlier (10,000), which heavily distorts the variance. Ignoring this is a classic analytical mistake.

## Mean
The mean represents the average income value. In this dataset, the mean is influenced by high-income values, which can distort the perception of typical income.

## Median
The median represents the middle income value and provides a more robust measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.

## Mode
The mode represents the most frequent income value. In this dataset, the mode has limited interpretative value due to low repetition of values.

## Variance and Standard Deviation
Variance and standard deviation measure income dispersion. High values indicate significant variability in income levels.

## Interpretation
The analysis shows that income distribution is skewed, with high-income outliers affecting the mean more than the median. This highlights the importance of choosing appropriate statistical measures when analyzing income data.


Results

Population variance 

		??2 = 5,878,100

Sample variance 

		??2 = 6,531,222.22


What you are overlooking (and shouldn’t)

The variance explodes almost entirely because of the 10,000 value.

Without this value, variance would drop dramatically.

In real-world Data Analysis, this requires:

Outlier analysis

Use of IQR, boxplots, log transformation, or winsorization

Using this “raw” variance for business or supply chain decisions will lead to bad conclusions.

When to use each one

Population variance ? when you have the entire population.


Sample variance ? when this is just a sample (which is almost always the case in practice).
