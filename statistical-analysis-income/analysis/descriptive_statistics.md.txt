Mean = 3170

Median = 2350

Mode = There is no determined fashion for the project

Variance = This dataset contains a severe outlier (10,000), which heavily distorts the variance. Ignoring this is a classic analytical mistake.


Results

Population variance 

		??2 = 5,878,100

Sample variance 

		??2 = 6,531,222.22


What you are overlooking (and shouldn’t)

The variance explodes almost entirely because of the 10,000 value.

Without this value, variance would drop dramatically.

In real-world Data Analysis, this requires:

Outlier analysis

Use of IQR, boxplots, log transformation, or winsorization

Using this “raw” variance for business or supply chain decisions will lead to bad conclusions.

When to use each one

Population variance ? when you have the entire population.

Sample variance ? when this is just a sample (which is almost always the case in practice).
